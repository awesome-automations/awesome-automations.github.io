This web site is developed out of fascination to capture some of that hard-to-find creativity and share it with the rest of the community. I usually spend a lot of time following so many people via their blogs, web sites, github repositories, and often interacting with them on discord and other channels. People often come up with uniqe and interesting ways of solving their home automation needs, and I found that no two automations are alike! There is so much variation for the common set of problems is what caused me to build this site!

I'd love to get your thoughts and feedback on whatelse we can capture to make this worthwhile. Please feel free to [drop me a note](https://github.com/awesome-automations/home/issues/new) or use Disqus feature below. You can also reach me on the [Home Assistant's discord channel](https://www.home-assistant.io/join-chat/). My username on discord is `@skalavala`

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you found some of the automations interesting, useful and fascinating!
