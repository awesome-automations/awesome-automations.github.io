This web site is created to capture some of that creativity and share with the rest of the world. I spend a lot of time following so many people via their blogs, web sites, github repositories, and often interacting with them on discord and other channels. People often come up with uniqe and interesting ways of solving their home automation needs, some are super creative!

I'd love to get your thoughts and feedback on whatelse we can capture to make this more consumable. Please feel free to contact me or use `Disqus` feature which you will find throughout this site (where applicable).

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you found some of the automations interesting, useful and fascinating!
